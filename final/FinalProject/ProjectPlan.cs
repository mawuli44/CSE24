Project plan (open-ended project)
The plan of my project is to Create and design a system thus home automated system 
that will allow users to control various aspects of their home such as lighting, temperature, 
security cameras and appliances remotely through a web or mobile interface. 
Sensors would be incorporated to automate certain tasks based on environmental conditions or user preferences.
The program shall be written in C# and all specifications and guidelines associated.
